# Meta-Workflow: Adaptive Task Execution

This is the master workflow that determines the best approach for any task and composes specialized workflows as needed.

## The 7-Step Process (Updated: Quality Gates Before Scrutiny)

### Step 1: Plan Approach

**Assess the task and determine strategy**

Ask:

- What is the user asking for?
- What context do I already have?
- What workflows might apply?
- Is this simple enough to skip directly to execution?

**Decision Matrix:**

| Your Request      | Strategy                                | Example                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| "What does X do?" | Direct response (information query)     | "What does this function do?" |
| "Fix typo"        | Direct execution                        | "Fix typo in heading"         |
| "Plan X"          | Use /workflows:plan with parallel research | "Plan JWT auth system"     |
| "Work this plan"  | Use /workflows:work with quality gates   | Execute structured plan      |
| "Review code"     | Use /workflows:review parallel agents   | "Review my PR"                |
| "New feature"     | Select workflow(s) - TDD + UI-iteration | "Add contact form"            |
| "Bug fix"         | Use bug-fix-workflow                    | "Navigation not working"      |
| "UI work"         | Use ui-iteration-workflow               | "Redesign hero section"       |
| "Tests needed"    | Use tdd-workflow                        | "Add form validation"         |
| "Complex task"    | Compose multiple workflows              | "New e-commerce checkout"     |

**Output:** Decision + selected workflow(s) OR "skip to step 4"

---

### Step 2: Explore (If Needed)

**Gather missing information**

Only execute if Step 1 determined more context is needed.

Actions:

- Read relevant files (use Glob/Grep to find them)
- Examine existing patterns in the codebase
- Check dependencies and imports
- Review similar existing implementations
- Look at git history for context
- **Update or create context documents** for areas explored

**Context Capture:**

- When exploring a new area, check if a context doc exists: `.claude/context/[area]--context.md`
- If not, create one using the context template (see [`plan-manager`](.claude/skills/plan-manager/SKILL.md) skill)
- Reference context docs with links, not duplicated content
- Run `update-indexes` after creating new context docs

**When to explore:**

- New feature area you haven't worked with
- Bug fix where root cause is unclear
- Task requires understanding existing patterns
- User asks something open-ended

**Output:** Return to Step 1 with updated context

---

### Step 3: Plan Solution

**Create detailed implementation plan**

Only execute if Step 1 determined a workflow is needed OR if task requires planning.

Actions:

- Based on selected workflow(s), create step-by-step plan
- List files that will be modified
- Identify potential risks or edge cases
- Specify testing approach
- Estimate complexity

**Plan Capture:**

- Create a plan document: `.claude/plans/active/YYYY-MM-DD--[slug].md`
- Use the plan template (see [`plan-manager`](.claude/skills/plan-manager/SKILL.md) skill)
- Set `status: planning` initially
- Reference related context documents

**If multiple workflows apply:**

- Compose them logically (e.g., TDD for behavior, then UI-iteration for visuals)
- Create unified plan that addresses both

**Output:** Detailed implementation plan + get user approval

---

### Step 3.5: Plan Scrutiny (Mandatory for All Plans)

**Multi-agent validation of plan and exploration completeness**

**CRITICAL: All subagents MUST read CLAUDE.md before starting their review**

Before proceeding to execution, validate the plan using multiple specialized subagents to ensure:

1. **Exploration Completeness** - 95%+ confidence all needed context was gathered
2. **Plan Viability** - 95%+ confidence the plan will work considering all edge cases

**Execute Parallel Scrutiny Agents:**

Each agent MUST be instructed to:
1. First read the full `CLAUDE.md` file at the project root
2. Review the **Skills Index** at `.claude/skills/index.md` to discover available skills
3. Check for **available specialized agents** from installed marketplace plugins
4. Then read the relevant workflow file(s)
5. Then perform their specialized review (invoking skills as needed)

**Agent Discovery:**

First, check what review agents are available from installed plugins. If specialized agents exist (e.g., from the dev plugin), use them. Otherwise, fall back to generic prompts.

**How to discover agents programmatically:**

1. **Check marketplace.json** for installed plugins and their agents:
   ```bash
   # Read .claude-plugin/marketplace.json to find installed plugins
   # Each plugin lists its agents in the "agents" array
   ```

2. **Check plugin directories** for agent definitions:
   ```bash
   # Look for SKILL.md files in:
   plugins/*/agents/review/*/SKILL.md
   plugins/*/agents/research/*/SKILL.md
   ```

3. **Use Glob tool** to find available agents:
   ```
   Glob pattern: plugins/*/agents/**/SKILL.md
   ```

4. **Read agent SKILL.md** to verify the agent exists and get its instructions

```bash
# Check for available review agents by examining installed plugins
# Look for agents/ directories in plugin structures

# If specialized agents ARE available, use them for plan scrutiny:
Agent 1 (or architecture-strategist if available)
Agent 2 (or security-sentinel if available)
Agent 3 (or performance-oracle if available)
Agent 4 (or pattern-recognition-specialist if available)
Agent 5 (or repo-research-analyst if available)

# If specialized agents are NOT available, use generic prompts:
Agent 1: Context Completeness Reviewer
Agent 2: Edge Case Analyzer
Agent 3: Architecture & Patterns Reviewer
Agent 4: Risk Assessment Reviewer
```

**Generic Fallback Prompts** (use when specialized agents unavailable):

```bash
Agent 1: Context Completeness Reviewer
  INSTRUCTION: "First read CLAUDE.md. Then review .claude/skills/index.md. Then review the plan for:
  - Was the explore step thorough?
  - Are there gaps in our understanding of the codebase?
  - Did we miss relevant files, patterns, or dependencies?
  - Are context documents accurate and complete?
  - Use relevant skills (e.g., plan-manager, quality-severity) for deeper analysis if needed."

Agent 2: Edge Case Analyzer
  INSTRUCTION: "First read CLAUDE.md. Then review .claude/skills/index.md. Then review the plan for:
  - What edge cases might break this implementation?
  - Are error scenarios handled?
  - What about empty states, null/undefined values, race conditions?
  - Does the plan account for accessibility, responsive design, i18n?
  - Use relevant skills for framework-specific edge case analysis if needed."

Agent 3: Architecture & Patterns Reviewer
  INSTRUCTION: "First read CLAUDE.md. Then review .claude/skills/index.md. Then review the plan for:
  - Does this follow project conventions described in CLAUDE.md?
  - Are we introducing anti-patterns?
  - Will this integrate cleanly with existing code?
  - Are dependencies managed correctly?
  - Use framework skills (latest-astro, latest-react, etc.) for framework-specific review if needed."

Agent 4: Risk Assessment Reviewer
  INSTRUCTION: "First read CLAUDE.md. Then review .claude/skills/index.md. Then review the plan for:
  - What could go wrong during implementation?
  - Are there potential breaking changes?
  - What's the rollback strategy?
  - Are test cases comprehensive?
  - Use playwright-test skill for test strategy review if needed."
```

**Specialized Agent Instructions** (when available):

When specialized agents are discovered, instruct each to:

```bash
AGENT_TEMPLATE: "First read CLAUDE.md. Then review .claude/skills/index.md to discover available skills.
Then perform your specialized review of this plan from your domain expertise perspective.
Classify all findings using P1/P2/P3 severity (see quality-severity skill)."
```

**Severity Classification:**

All findings MUST be classified using P1/P2/P3 severity levels (see `quality-severity` skill if available):

- **P1 (Critical)**: Blocks implementation - fundamental flaws, missing critical context
- **P2 (Important)**: Should address - significant gaps, risky approaches
- **P3 (Nice-to-Have)**: Consider addressing - minor improvements, optimizations

**Scrutiny Process:**

1. Discover available agents from installed marketplace plugins
2. Launch available agents in parallel using Task tool (or use generic fallback)
3. Each agent independently reviews the plan document
4. Agents provide specific findings with:
   - **Severity**: P1 (Critical) / P2 (Important) / P3 (Nice-to-Have) [or Critical/High/Medium/Low if quality-severity unavailable]
   - **Category**: Architecture / Security / Performance / Patterns / Exploration
   - **Finding**: Description of concern
   - **Recommendation**: Specific action to address
   - **Confidence Score**: 0-100% on plan viability
5. Aggregate findings by severity
6. Address all P1 findings before proceeding
7. Address P2 findings if time permits
8. Note P3 findings for future consideration
9. Update plan document with scrutiny results in `scrutiny:` section including:
   - `p1_findings: N`
   - `p2_findings: N`
   - `p3_findings: N`
   - `confidence_score: XX`
10. Get final user approval if P1 issues were addressed

**Output:** Validated plan with severity-classified findings + confidence scores OR refined plan

---

### Step 4: Execute

**Implement the solution**

Actions:

- Follow the plan from Step 3 (or execute directly if skipped from Step 1)
- Create/modify files as needed
- Follow project conventions from CLAUDE.md
- Use appropriate tools (Edit, Write, etc.)
- Work systematically through the plan

**During execution:**

- Be explicit about what you're doing
- Call out decisions as you make them
- Pause if you encounter something unexpected
- **Update plan document**: Mark each step's status as you progress (`pending` → `in_progress` → `completed`)
- **Update `updated:` timestamp** whenever you modify the plan

**Plan Tracking:**

- Set `status: in_progress` and `started: <date>` when beginning execution
- Update individual step statuses as you work through them
- Add notes to steps for discoveries, deviations, or decisions

**Output:** Implementation complete

---

### Step 5: Quality Gates

**Validate and verify**

**Always run these gates in a closed loop until all pass:**

Read the project's `CLAUDE.md` file to find the Quality Gates section. This section should define the specific commands to run for:

1. **Type Checks** - Type checking and validation
2. **Lint Check** - Code quality and style enforcement
3. **Build Verification** - Production build validation
4. **Run Tests** (if applicable) - Unit, integration, and E2E tests

**If CLAUDE.md doesn't have a Quality Gates section:**

Look for common scripts in `package.json`:
- Type checking scripts (e.g., typecheck, check, validate)
- Linting scripts (e.g., lint, lint:fix)
- Build scripts (e.g., build, compile)
- Test scripts (e.g., test, test:unit, test:e2e)

5. **Manual Verification**
   - Did I address the user's request?
   - Did I follow the selected workflow?
   - Are there any obvious issues?
   - Should I suggest next steps?

**If any gate fails:**

- **Diagnose the failure first:**

  ```bash
  # For test failures - check server logs
  # Use PM2 if available (check coder-environment skill), or container logs

  # Check process status
  # Use appropriate process manager commands
  ```

- Fix the issue
- Re-run the gate
- Don't proceed until all pass
- **Loop until all gates pass** - This is a tight feedback loop for automated checks

**Output:** All quality gates passing

---

### Step 6: Implementation Scrutiny (Mandatory for All Non-Trivial Code Changes)

**Multi-agent validation of implementation quality**

**CRITICAL: All subagents MUST read CLAUDE.md before starting their review**

After quality gates pass, validate the implementation using multiple specialized subagents to ensure:

1. **Best Practices** - 95%+ confidence code follows best practices
2. **Edge Case Coverage** - 95%+ confidence all edge cases are handled
3. **No Regressions** - 95%+ confidence no new bugs were introduced
4. **Documentation** - 95%+ confidence plan status was properly documented

**Why this comes AFTER quality gates:**

- Agents review code that already passes all automated checks
- More efficient - no need to re-scrutinize after fixing typecheck/lint errors
- Final "green light" before completion

**Execute Parallel Scrutiny Agents:**

Each agent MUST be instructed to:
1. First read the full `CLAUDE.md` file at the project root
2. Review the **Skills Index** at `.claude/skills/index.md` to discover available skills
3. Check for **available specialized agents** from installed marketplace plugins
4. Then read the relevant workflow file(s)
5. Then perform their specialized review (invoking skills as needed)

**Agent Discovery:**

First, check what review agents are available from installed plugins. If specialized agents exist (e.g., from the dev plugin), use them. Otherwise, fall back to generic prompts.

**How to discover agents programmatically:**

1. **Check marketplace.json** for installed plugins and their agents:
   ```bash
   # Read .claude-plugin/marketplace.json to find installed plugins
   # Each plugin lists its agents in the "agents" array
   ```

2. **Check plugin directories** for agent definitions:
   ```bash
   # Look for SKILL.md files in:
   plugins/*/agents/review/*/SKILL.md
   plugins/*/agents/research/*/SKILL.md
   ```

3. **Use Glob tool** to find available agents:
   ```
   Glob pattern: plugins/*/agents/**/SKILL.md
   ```

4. **Read agent SKILL.md** to verify the agent exists and get its instructions

```bash
# Check for available review agents by examining installed plugins
# Look for agents/ directories in plugin structures

# If specialized agents ARE available, use them for implementation scrutiny:
Agent 1 (or architecture-strategist if available)
Agent 2 (or security-sentinel if available)
Agent 3 (or performance-oracle if available)
Agent 4 (or code-simplicity-reviewer if available)
Agent 5 (or agent-native-reviewer if available)
Agent 6 (or pattern-recognition-specialist if available)
Agent 7 (or data-integrity-guardian if available)
Agent 8 (or julik-frontend-races-reviewer if available)
Agent 9 (or deployment-verification-agent if available - only for production changes)

# If specialized agents are NOT available, use generic prompts:
Agent 1: Code Quality Reviewer
Agent 2: Edge Case & Error Handling Reviewer
Agent 3: Integration & Regression Reviewer
Agent 4: Testing & Documentation Reviewer
Agent 5: Security & Performance Reviewer
```

**Generic Fallback Prompts** (use when specialized agents unavailable):

```bash
Agent 1: Code Quality Reviewer
  INSTRUCTION: "First read CLAUDE.md. Then review .claude/skills/index.md. Then review the implementation for:
  - Does this code follow project conventions in CLAUDE.md?
  - Are variable names clear and descriptive?
  - Is the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)?
  - Are functions single-purpose and focused?
  - Are there any code smells or anti-patterns?
  - Use framework skills (latest-astro, latest-react, etc.) for framework-specific review if needed."

Agent 2: Edge Case & Error Handling Reviewer
  INSTRUCTION: "First read CLAUDE.md. Then review .claude/skills/index.md. Then review the implementation for:
  - Are all error cases handled?
  - What happens with null/undefined values?
  - Are race conditions prevented?
  - Are boundaries and limits validated?
  - Is defensive programming applied appropriately?
  - Use framework skills for framework-specific edge case patterns if needed."

Agent 3: Integration & Regression Reviewer
  INSTRUCTION: "First read CLAUDE.md. Then review .claude/skills/index.md. Then review the implementation for:
  - Does this integrate cleanly with existing code?
  - Could this break existing functionality?
  - Are all imports and dependencies correct?
  - Did we properly update related files?
  - Are type definitions accurate and complete?
  - Use framework skills for integration patterns if needed."

Agent 4: Testing & Documentation Reviewer
  INSTRUCTION: "First read CLAUDE.md. Then review .claude/skills/index.md. Then review the implementation for:
  - Are tests comprehensive for the changes?
  - Do tests cover edge cases?
  - Is the plan document updated with completion status?
  - Are comments clear where needed?
  - Will future maintainers understand this code?
  - Use playwright-test skill for test quality review if tests were modified."

Agent 5: Security & Performance Reviewer
  INSTRUCTION: "First read CLAUDE.md. Then review .claude/skills/index.md. Then review the implementation for:
  - Are there any security vulnerabilities (XSS, injection, etc.)?
  - Are user inputs properly validated?
  - Could this introduce performance issues?
  - Are queries optimized?
  - Is memory usage appropriate?
  - Use relevant skills for framework-specific security patterns if needed."
```

**Specialized Agent Instructions** (when available):

When specialized agents are discovered, instruct each to:

```bash
AGENT_TEMPLATE: "First read CLAUDE.md. Then review .claude/skills/index.md to discover available skills.
Then perform your specialized review of this implementation from your domain expertise perspective.
Classify all findings using P1/P2/P3 severity (see quality-severity skill)."
```

**Severity Classification:**

All findings MUST be classified using P1/P2/P3 severity levels (see `quality-severity` skill if available):

- **P1 (Critical)**: Blocks merge - security vulnerabilities, data corruption, breaking changes
- **P2 (Important)**: Should fix - performance issues, architectural concerns, code clarity
- **P3 (Nice-to-Have)**: Enhancement - code cleanup, optimizations, documentation

**Scrutiny Process:**

1. Discover available agents from installed marketplace plugins
2. Launch available agents in parallel using Task tool (or use generic fallback)
3. Each agent independently reviews all changed files
4. Agents provide specific findings with:
   - **Severity**: P1 (Critical) / P2 (Important) / P3 (Nice-to-Have) [or Critical/High/Medium/Low if quality-severity unavailable]
   - **File**: Affected file path
   - **Line**: Specific line reference
   - **Finding**: Description of concern
   - **Recommendation**: Specific action to address
   - **Confidence Score**: 0-100% on implementation quality
5. Aggregate findings by severity
6. Address all P1 findings before completion
7. Address P2 findings if time permits
8. Note P3 findings for future consideration
9. If P1 or P2 issues found:
   - Fix them
   - Re-run quality gates (Step 5) - loop back
   - Re-run scrutiny (Step 6) - loop back
10. Update plan document with scrutiny results in `scrutiny:` section including:
    - `p1_findings: N`
    - `p2_findings: N`
    - `p3_findings: N`
    - `confidence_score: XX`

**Output:** Validated implementation with severity-classified findings + confidence scores

---

### Step 7: Plan Completion (Two-Stage Confirmation)

**Finalize and archive with user confirmation and quality gate verification**

#### Stage 1: User Confirmation

Before marking any work as complete, ask the user:

> "I believe the work is complete. Do you agree, or are there changes/problems you've uncovered?"

- **If user confirms**: Proceed to Stage 2
- **If user identifies issues**: Address them, then return to Stage 1
- **If user requests changes**: Make changes, then return to Stage 1

**Do NOT set `status: completed` until after Stage 2 passes.**

#### Stage 2: Quality Gate Verification

Only after user confirms, run the quality gates defined in the project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```bash
# Read CLAUDE.md Quality Gates section and run the defined commands:
# - Type checks
# - Linting
# - Build
# - Tests
```

**If CLAUDE.md doesn't define quality gates**, check `package.json` for common scripts.

**If all gates pass:**

- Set `status: completed`
- Set `completed: <date>`
- Set `quality_gates_passed: true`
- The auto-archive hook will automatically move the plan to archive

**If any gate fails:**

- Inform the user: "Quality checks failed. Would you like me to fix these now, or defer completion?"
- If user wants fixes: Fix issues, re-run gates, then repeat Stage 2
- If user wants to defer: Keep status as `in_progress`, add note about failed gates

**Output:** Summary of changes + verification status + archiving confirmation

## Quick Reference

### Available Workflows to Compose

| Workflow            | When to Use                           | File                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **/workflows:plan** | Create structured project plans       | `plugins/dev/commands/workflows/plan.md`     |
| **/workflows:work** | Execute plans with quality gates      | `plugins/dev/commands/workflows/work.md`     |
| **/workflows:review** | Multi-agent parallel code review   | `plugins/dev/commands/workflows/review.md`   |
| **/deepen-plan**    | Enhance existing plans with research  | `plugins/dev/commands/deepen-plan.md`        |
| **TDD**             | Behavior-heavy features               | `.claude/workflows/tdd-workflow.md`          |
| **UI Iteration**    | Visual/design work                    | `.claude/workflows/ui-iteration-workflow.md` |
| **Bug Fix**         | Debugging issues                      | `.claude/workflows/bug-fix-workflow.md`      |

### Quality Gates Commands

Quality gates should be defined in the project's `CLAUDE.md` file under a "Quality Gates" section.

**If not defined in CLAUDE.md**, look for common scripts in `package.json`:

- Type checking scripts (typecheck, check, validate)
- Linting scripts (lint, lint:fix)
- Build scripts (build, compile)
- Test scripts (test, test:unit, test:e2e)

---

## Meta-Workflow Rules

1. **Always start at Step 1** - Never skip the approach decision
2. **Explore only when needed** - Don't read files unnecessarily
3. **Plan for complexity** - Simple tasks can skip Step 3 (and thus Step 3.5)
4. **Scrutinize all plans** - Step 3.5 is mandatory when Step 3 creates a plan
5. **Quality gates are closed-loop** - Step 5 loops until all pass (tight feedback loop)
6. **Scrutinize after gates pass** - Step 6 reviews code that already passes automated checks
7. **Scrutiny findings loop back** - Critical/High issues trigger Step 5 → Step 6 re-run
8. **Compose workflows intelligently** - Multiple workflows can apply
9. **Be explicit** - State which step you're on
10. **Ask when uncertain** - If the approach is unclear, ask the user

### When to Skip Steps

**Step 3.5 (Plan Scrutiny)** - Skip when:

- No plan was created (direct execution from Step 1)
- Change is trivial (typo, simple text update)

**Step 6 (Implementation Scrutiny)** - Skip when:

- No code was written (documentation only)
- Change is trivial (single-line fix, obvious typo)

**Step 7 (Plan Completion)** - Skip when:

- No plan was created (direct execution)

When in doubt, run scrutiny - it's better to over-verify than introduce bugs.

### Key Flow Pattern

**Quality Gates Loop (Step 5):** Tight automated feedback loop

- Run type checks → fail → fix → re-run
- Run linting → fail → fix → re-run
- Run build → fail → fix → re-run
- Repeat quickly until all pass

**Scrutiny Loop (Step 6):** Deeper human-like review

- Only runs AFTER all quality gates pass
- If issues found: fix → re-run Step 5 → re-run Step 6
- More expensive, so we want stable code first

## For Claude: How to Use This Workflow

When a user makes a request, mentally run through:

1. **What kind of request is this?** → Determines Step 1 output
2. **Do I need more context?** → Determines if Step 2 runs
3. **How complex is this?** → Determines if Step 3 runs
4. **Validate the plan** → Step 3.5 (if Step 3 ran)
5. **Execute** → Step 4
6. **Quality gates (closed loop)** → Step 5 (always - loop until pass)
7. **Scrutinize implementation** → Step 6 (if non-trivial)
8. **Complete plan with two-stage confirmation** → Step 7 (if plan exists)
   - Stage 1: Ask user "Do you agree the work is complete?"
   - Stage 2: Run quality gates
   - Then set status: completed

**Then explicitly state:**

> "Based on your request, I'll [describe approach]. Let me start by [Step X]."

This keeps the user informed and makes the workflow transparent.
